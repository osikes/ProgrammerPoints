- gridlines not completely working in PPGridTableCell.m (comment above relevant section)

- add second set of mock/static data to use for populating the table.
- add an if statement based on the segmented control that will choose which set of arrays to pull info from.

- add arrays for the indicator images.

- make the green arrow/blue dot only show up for the selected idiot, and remove the default blue highlighting.

- add title headings for the table columns.

- subclass navigation bar so that it has the right image/background and isn't blue.

- subclass the switch so that it also looks right (probably similar to the navigation bar part).
